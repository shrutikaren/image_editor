# image_editor
This is a Python Image Editor that allows the users to browse an image and then perform functionalities with the image accordingly. 

Purpose: The purpose of this software is to allow users to have a chance to edit images and photographs from their own local computer without the need of external softwares for basic edits. Some computers may have editing photo features in their gallery. However, they may lack features on adding effects to the image. Hence, with this project, I hope to allow users to edit their own images and photographs locally from their own computers with this simple Python project of mine. 

For our canvas page, my expectation for the design to appear visually would be as follows. The code written for this project was taking this design into consideration and to ensure that the final product would contain these features as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). For the Maximum Viable Product, more features and additional designs will be added accordingly to ensure that users using this editor can go beyond than just simple option selection.

For this project, a full documentation is added and it is labeled as "Image_Editor_Python_Documentation". The PDF document is added to this repository. The entire project takes into consideration that if a beginner is interested to learn from this project, there are some simple walkthrough information inside the "Learning_Curve" folder that consists of the demo_cv.png and the demo.py files. Both of these files are heavily commented to ensure that most of the items can be easily understood. 

The main file for the project is the project.py. To run this project, simply download the repository to your local computer. On your terminal, type in python project.py that allows you to run the file and have the main prompt window open for you to finally start editing your images!
